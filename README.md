# Secure Password Generator

## Description

This project is a Secure Password Generator. It is designed to create a new, secure password based on user-selected criteria.

## How it Works

1. **Start the Process**: Move the slider button to generate a password.

2. **Choose the Criteria**: You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. You can select which criteria to include in the password.

3. **Set the Length**: When prompted for the length of the password, choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

4. **Select Character Types**: When prompted for character types to include in the password, choose from lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

5. **Validate Input**: Your input will be validated and at least one character type should be selected.

6. **Generate the Password**: Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

7. **Display the Password**: The generated password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Usage

To use the Secure Password Generator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser and follow the prompts to generate your secure password.
